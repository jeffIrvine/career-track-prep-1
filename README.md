## Objects
New syntax and object initilization was brought by ES6, this allows for shorthand keyvalue pair assignment, and computed property names which allows you to use "logic" to assign a computed value as a property name. Super cool.

## Classes
From learning prototype relationships to inhereted functions, delete and create operators, the classes topic has a lot going on; my favorite being inherited functions. 

## Destructuring
Destructuring seems to have a lot of power, from cleaner code to destructoring in arrays allows for movement of variables and what I think will help me with dynamic code in the future.

## Rest
Rest allows for potentially many elements to collapse at the end of an array, creating a new array, rest also allows you to grab parameters passed to a function.

## Spread 
Spread expands a number of elements from a single element notated by ...varName this allows iteration and is short hand for the elements represented. 

## Function Defaults 
Function defaults allow you to assign a default value even when one or more parameters are not passed as arguments in a function call avoiding undefined from being returned as would normally happen.
